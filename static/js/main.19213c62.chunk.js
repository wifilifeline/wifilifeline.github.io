Access to the internet has become more important than ever. Internet access is necessary to live in today\u2019s world\u2014necessary to work, to go to school, to get healthcare.","ParagraphVision2":"Now, we are calling on the public officials of Seattle and King County to honor the United Nations declaration that \u201caccess to internet is a basic human right\u201d by providing free and unlimited WiFi access to all.","HeaderImpact":"Who is impacted by lack of WiFi?","HeaderStudents":"Students and youth","ParagraphStudents1":"Students and families are experiencing an unprecedented school year. With remote learning in every school district in King County, kids who do not have access to WiFi effectively do not have access to their education. ","ParagraphStudents2":"Remote learning is hard enough on students and families; lack of internet access should not be an added challenge. This barrier is especially high for families with multiple students in school, as low-cost internet services do not provide the bandwidth needed to carry multiple devices at once. In order to ensure equitable learning experiences for all students, we need free high-speed internet access.","HeaderWorkers":"Workers","ParagraphWorkers1":"The pandemic has caused an intense economic crisis, with over 30 million workers losing their jobs.

By providing free WiFi, we can help our communities rebuild in response to the COVID-19 recession.","HeaderSurvivors":"Survivors","ParagraphSurvivors1":"Internet access is vital to safety because abuse and violence thrive in isolation. We can combat the isolation created by the pandemic by providing internet access that allows people to connect online and have access to resources. According to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN), for the first time ever, over half the people who called the sexual abuse hotline were under the age of 18, and from those calls, 79% were living with the person causing the harm.","ParagraphSurvivors2":"While service providers are working hard to provide support for survivors online, those without internet access are unreachable. While public hotspots can be helpful for temporary WiFi access, these services do not provide the privacy and security survivors need to access many resources (like financial, legal, and counseling services)."}')},16:function(e,a,s){"use strict";s.r(a);var t=s(0),n=s(1),i=s.n(n),r=s(3),o=s.n(r),c=(s(13),s(4)),l=s(5),d=s(7),h=s(6),p=(s(14),s.p+"static/media/header.4c7b2228.png"),u=s.p+"static/media/image-students.910499f4.png",m=s.p+"static/media/image-workers.97333e8a.png",v=s.p+"static/media/image-survivors.6c7bfbf8.png",g=s(15),b="https://tinyurl.com/wifiisalifeline",j=function(e){Object(d.a)(s,e);var a=Object(h.a)(s);function s(){var e;Object(c.a)(this,s);for(var t=arguments.length,n=new Array(t),i=0;i<t;i++)n[i]=arguments[i];return(e=a.call.apply(a,[this].concat(n)))._onVisionClick=function(){document.getElementsByClassName("container-vision")[0].scrollIntoView()},e._onImpactClick=function(){document.getElementsByClassName("container-impact")[0].scrollIntoView()},e._onGetInvolvedClick=function(){document.getElementsByClassName("container-call-to-action")[0].scrollIntoView()},e._onGetInvolvedClickLink=function(){window.open(b,"_blank")},e}return Object(l.a)(s,[{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(t.jsxs)("div",{className:"page",children:[Object(t.jsxs)("div",{className:"container-title",children:[Object(t.jsx)("img",{className:"image-title",src:p,alt:"people"}),Object(t.jsx)("h1",{className:"title",children:g.HomePageTitle}),Object(t.jsx)("button",{className:"button-vision",onClick:this._onVisionClick,children:g.ButtonVision}),Object(t.jsx)("button",{className:"button-impact",onClick:this._onImpactClick,children:g.ButtonImpact}),Object(t.jsx)("button",{className:"button-get-involved",onClick:this._onGetInvolvedClickLink,children:g.ButtonGetInvolved}),Object(t.jsx)("h2",{className:"header-internet-access",children:g.HeaderInternetAccess})]}),Object(t.jsxs)("div",{className:"container-call-to-action",children:[Object(t.jsx)("h2",{className:"header-call-to-action",children:g.HeaderCallToAction}),Object(t.jsx)("p",{className:"paragraph-call-to-action",children:g.ParagraphCallToAction}),Object(t.jsx)("button",{className:"button-get-involved-link",onClick:this._onGetInvolvedClickLink,children:g.ButtonGetInvolved})]}),Object(t.jsxs)("div",{className:"container-impact",children:[Object(t.jsx)("h2",{className:"header-impact",children:g.HeaderImpact}),Object(t.jsxs)("div",{className:"container-students",children:[Object(t.jsx)("img",{className:"image-students",src:u,alt:"students and youth"}),Object(t.jsxs)("div",{className:"paragraph-container-students",children:[Object(t.jsx)("h3",{className:"header-students",children:g.HeaderStudents}),Object(t.jsx)("p",{className:"paragraph-students1",children:g.ParagraphStudents1}),Object(t.jsx)("p",{className:"paragraph-students2",children:g.ParagraphStudents2})]})]}),Object(t.jsxs)("div",{className:"container-workers",children:[Object(t.jsxs)("div",{className:"paragraph-container-workers",children:[Object(t.jsx)("h3",{className:"header-workers",children:g.HeaderWorkers}),Object(t.jsx)("p",{className:"paragraph-workers1",children:g.ParagraphWorkers1}),Object(t.jsx)("p",{className:"paragraph-workers2",children:g.ParagraphWorkers2})]}),Object(t.jsx)("img",{className:"image-workers",src:m,alt:"workers and youth"})]}),Object(t.jsxs)("div",{className:"container-survivors",children:[Object(t.jsx)("img",{className:"image-survivors",src:v,alt:"survivors and youth"}),Object(t.jsxs)("div",{className:"paragraph-container-survivors",children:[Object(t.jsx)("h3",{className:"header-survivors",children:g.HeaderSurvivors}),Object(t.jsx)("p",{className:"paragraph-survivors1",children:g.ParagraphSurvivors1}),Object(t.jsx)("p",{className:"paragraph-survivors2",children:g.ParagraphSurvivors2})]})]})]}),Object(t.jsxs)("div",{className:"container-vision",children:[Object(t.jsx)("h2",{className:"header-vision",children:g.HeaderVision}),Object(t.jsxs)("div",{className:"paragraph-container-vision",children:[Object(t.jsx)("p",{className:"paragraph-vision1",children:g.ParagraphVision1}),Object(t.jsx)("p",{className:"paragraph-vision2",children:g.ParagraphVision2})]})]})]})}}]),s}(i.a.Component),f=function(e){e&&e instanceof Function&&s.e(3).then(s.bind(null,17)).then((function(a){var s=a.getCLS,t=a.getFID,n=a.getFCP,i=a.getLCP,r=a.getTTFB;s(e),t(e),n(e),i(e),r(e)}))};o.a.render(Object(t.jsx)(i.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(t.jsx)(j,{})}),document.getElementById("root")),f()}},[[16,1,2]]]);
